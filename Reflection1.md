# In Class Reflection 

We are now living in the digital information era where human social life is rapidly digitalized. As big data is revolutionizing the way our world functions and human behaves, Jushua Bluenstock writes an article “Don’t forget people in the use of big data for development”, to reminds people the importance of taking advantage of big data to promote human development. At the same time, Bluenstock points out the latent problems and risks behind the extensive use of data and provides several ways forward as solutions.

Many changes caused by the data acquisition have already happened around the world. As Bluenstock mentioned, collecting data from consumers’ mobile phones leads to better performance of debt because people’s credit level is constantly evaluated by the machine learning algorithms. What’s more, collecting, tracking and analyzing each individual’s digital footprint helps with many global issues, such as preventing global epidemics and natural disasters, dealing with international crises and distributing humanitarian aid to poor countries in a more accurate way. In the past, we cannot efficiently get approach to individuals’ behavior, which leads to many invalid effort and money spending. Now along with “data revolution,” the government or other agencies are enabled to better target people who need to be helped.

However, our classmate Anna Raymond points out an important argument that “Good intent is not enough in data science when dealing with the problems which determine people's experiences.” In the history, a lot of bad consequences actually originated from good intent. Data is be a powerful tool, but if we don’t use it properly, it may cause widespread harm as well. One of the big underlying problems is the transparency issue as mentioned by classmate Nira Nair. The asymmetry of information can lead people with power and wealth to control the data and decide how to use them. On the other side, poor and less representative people are often marginalized by the data, and even at risk of being exploited. For example, Bluenstock mentioned that “a 2015 study in Rwanda found that only 51% of borrowers were aware of the interest rate they were being charged.” It’s also possible for people who understand how the algorithm works to create illusions, deceiving the computer algorithm in order to achieve certain purposes. For example, “some would pretend to live in a thatched structure adjacent to their main iron-roofed house to become eligible for the aid.” What’s more, Bluenstock also suggests that the rules and regulations for data collection and utilization needs prompt improvements as well. While being marveled by the prospering economics and living quality brought by big data, we need to realize our urgent need of establish a transparent and impartial system for the data to be used more safely and responsibly. 


Our classmate Kayla Seggelke also proposes that "the balancing act can become difficult" while promoting applications and demoralizing hinderances at the same time. It’s true that scaling a new technology is never an easy thing. But since there’s no decision to make under current situation, both the continuous application of data and the problem solving are in the must-do category, we need to continue digging into the technology while addressing the current problems through possible solutions Bluenstock puts forward at the same time. In this way, we are truly pursing for the true potential benefit for our society and the world as a whole.
