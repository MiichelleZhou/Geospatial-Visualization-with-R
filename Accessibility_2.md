The following plot describes the de facto location of human settlements and urban areas, the center lines of classified roadways and the location of health care facilities by type throughout Mutasa and Mutare, Zimbabwe.

Total population of Mutasa and Mutare is 429,586 (Mutasa has 167,462 and Mutare has 262,124), among which the urban areas accounts for a population of 56,014. In Mutasa, there're 66 distinctly defined human settlements or urban areas. In Mutasa, human settlements and urban areas are bunched together near the country's boarder, with a big urban area formed in the northeast of Mutasa. In Mutare, human settlements and urban areas are evenly spread out over its territory, with smaller size.  

The distribution of roadways in these two citys of province Manicaland indicates that the urban area in these two adm2s is not fully developed yet. Because there's not a single complete mainline built throughout areas where human activies are most frequent. Primary and secondary roadways are always segmented. Also, there's a lack of healthcare facilities in these two cities as well, especially for the urban areas.
