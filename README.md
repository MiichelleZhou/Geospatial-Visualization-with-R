# My Repository for DATA 100 Wicked Problems
Hi everyone, my name is Michelle Zhou. I'm a freshman student from College of William and Mary. I'm full of interest in economics, statistics and data science. My intended major is Business Analytics and Data Science. I love cooking, travaling, and playing music in my spare time. I've been playing violin for 14 years and just started learning guitar. Looking forward to the opportunities to learn more and cooperate with you guys!
