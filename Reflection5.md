As a product of this high-tech era, big data is changing human’s behavior while helping us understand the complex social networks and human interactions. It not only “reframes the epistemology of science, social science and humanities”, but also provides an unprecedented space and potential for people to understand the cities, communities, organizations and enterprises. Although the data accuracy and security are still in an urgent need of improvements, the rapid development and popularization of data science leads to constant progress in improving algorithms and give birth to a brand-new society form.


Nowadays, people's interaction with intenet can be seen everywhere, and these behaviors are all recorded in the form of data. These data are known as digital traces of human interaction, and their value for social research is increasingly being recognized. The use of big data greatly enriches and expands the research of political science, economics, sociology, communication and other fields. Our lifestyle, way of thinking and the entire mindset are all quickly changed by the advent of data. Rob Kitchen evaluates this paradigm shifts in his article “Big Data, New Epistemologies and Paradigm Shifts,” indicating that the revolution in measurement closely integrates data science with the study of social science and human development, resulting in huge number of new discoveries in the interdisciplinary field of study. 


Big data also provides profound insights for enterprises and professionals to understand the complex human behavior and cities we're living in. As Geoff West argues in his article "Scale", there're extremely simple theories underlying the complex systems. "Scaling theory provides a powerful tool for forging a middle ground in which a quantitative framework can be developed for understanding and predicting the coarse-grained behavior of many broad aspects of such systems". His argument informs people why is big data useful while also reminds us that whether the utilization of data is effective is not dependent on the mere quantity of data but also effectiveness of framework and organization. The impact of big data analytics is two-sided. For example, on the good side, data analysis can help us collect data about diseases to develop new drugs, but on the other side, it can reveal private information about our personal health. Therefore we need to pay attention to both the accuracy and the security while using data.


Today's society is a rapidly developing society, with advanced science and technology impacting our daily life. Due to various characteristics of big data, such as the huge volume, the velocity and the exhaustiveness in scope, big data will continuously devleop and change human's behavior in the future. We should expect data science brings more insights to our understanding of life while keep alert of the potential risks along with its rapid develeopment.
