The advent of big data brings up revolutionary changes in measurement level, leading to a “new mode of science” in virtue of its high efficiency and ability to be widely applied to various natural and social science areas. Big data fundamentally changes the mindset of doing social science and humanities research and reframes the methodology of knowledge production, what we called “paradigm shifts”. In Rob Kitchen’s article “Big Data, New Epistemologies and Paradigm Shifts,” he further analyzes how this revolution in measurement closely integrates data science with the study of social science and human development, resulting in huge number of new discoveries in the interdisciplinary field of study. 

Rob Kitchen first summarizes the main characteristics of big data that makes it so impactful. The huge volume and velocity endow it huge computing power; its exhaustiveness in scope allows it to analyze the entire population or systems; its relation in nature and extensionality enables interdisciplinary and close-to-life studies. Those characteristics make big data be widely used in fields like measurements from sensors embedded into objects or environments, or consumer analysis by navigating through website or app and finding partterns through the whole population's purchases recordings. As Rob says, the development of Big Data and new data analytics offers the possibility of “reframing the epistemology of science, social science and humanities, and such a reframing is already actively taking place across disciplines." It enlarges the application scope of data science, allowing data to be used to explain complex natural and social phenomenon and subsequently improving our life quality. 

When data deluge “makes the scientific method obsolete”, the development of new mindset gives people new inspiration on better understanding human behavior.  Anderson argues in his article “End of Theory” that now we can analyze the data without hypothesis, without coherent models or unified theories but make valuable discoveries. In this way, analysts can find out surprising relationships and patterns that “we didn’t even know to look for.” When correlations can be found without firstly proposing a hypothesis, many previously unnoticed correlations are able to be discovered even though no “context and domain-specific expertise” are given. Big data therefore gives our many new insights on analyzing and understanding human behavior. 

The era of big data already comes, but the devleopment of data science are still facing a number of challenges, including a skills deficit and creation of a more comprehensive epistemological approach. But still, data science brings computational social science into a new level and is promoting more and more interdisciplinary studies.
