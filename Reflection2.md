# In Class Reflection #2

The advent of big data brings up revolutionary changes in measurement level, leading to a “new mode of science” in virtue of its high efficiency and ability to be widely applied to various natural and social science areas. Big data fundamentally changes the mindset of doing social science and humanities research and reframes the methodology of knowledge production, what we called “paradigm shifts”. In Rob Kitchen’s article “Big Data, New Epistemologies and Paradigm Shifts,” he further analyzes how this revolution in measurement closely integrates data science with the study of social science and human development, resulting in huge number of new discoveries in the interdisciplinary field of study. 

Rob Kitchen first summarizes the main characteristics of big data that makes it so impactful. The huge volume and velocity endow it huge computing power; its exhaustiveness in scope allows it to analyze the entire population or systems; its relation in nature and extensionality enables interdisciplinary and close-to-life studies. 
When data deluge “makes the scientific method obsolete”, the development of new mindset gives people new inspiration in better understanding human behavior.  Anderson argues in his article “End of Theory” that now we can analyze the data without hypothesis, without coherent models or unified theories but make valuable discoveries. In this way, analysts find out surprising relationships and patterns that “we didn’t even know to look for.” When correlations can be found without firstly proposing a hypothesis, many previously unnoticed correlations are discovered without “con- text and domain-specific expertise”
According to Rob, the positivistic approaches have been well established in subjects like economics, political science and sociology, but not in humanities. However,  the development of Big Data and new data analytics offers the possibility of “reframing the epistemology of science, social science and humanities, and such a reframing is already actively taking place across disciplines.

Positivistic approaches are well estab- lished in economics, political science, human geography and sociology, but are rare in the humanities. However, within those disciplines mentioned, there has been a strong move over the past half century towards post- positivist approaches, especially in human geography and sociology. 
It also poses a number of chal- lenges, including a skills deficit for analysing and making sense of such data, and the creation of an epis- temological approach that enables post-positivist forms of computational social science
