### Challenge Question 1
The plots below are two combined histogram with density plots that describe the correlationship between Zimbabwe's population at the adm2 level as a dependent variable and two of the other variables you (log of population 2020 and sum of ntl respectively).

![logpop20](hist_density_logpop.png)   
The distribution of the population density in respect of the log of population is approximiatly normal, with a little skewness to right. 
![slope](hist_density_ntl.png)  
The distribution of the population density in respect of the sum of ntl is strongly skew to right.
