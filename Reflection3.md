# In class Reflection #3

## Question 1 
Owen Barder's definition of development is highly in alignment with Amartya Sen's thought, that is development is is not only based on the increase in income, but more about enlarging people's choices, capabilities and freedoms. But Barner also extend Amartya's definition, arguing that in addition to the well being of people and the output of firms, development is also a property of the economic and social system.

## Question 2
The toaster project is proposed by a British design student Thomas Thwaites. He attempted to make an electric toaster, producing all its parts, from scratch. He bought a toaster model to study its composition, went to an iron ore mine to get the iron, used rubbish bins and leaf blower to melt the iron, but things are not that easy. After tons of trial and error, Thomas spent unimaginable amount of time, money and effort to prepare all the different materials and assemble them into a toaster. However, his toaster only worked five seconds and burned out, which cannot be regarded as a success in my opinion. Owen is trying to use this example to indicate that even making the simplest toaster is that complicated, not to mention the operation of our economy. He finally reaches to his conclusion about the complexity of the world's development, which is a complex system containing the cooperation from all the departments, institutions, firms and technology, to provide the citizens with the capabilities to live fulfilling lives.


## Question 3 
Barder argues that many economics models are created in the past 50 years, but they all have drawbacks. These models are either too simple that have no resemblance to the reality so that fail to explain the huge gap between rich and poor countries, or involving new factors that are hard to be explained well. When some economists attribute the misalignment of their expected economic development and the reality into bad government policies or institutions, governments put forwards many reform plans but they are all failed. Therefore, although we now know that the stagnant development in poor countries is caused by some endogenous reasons instead of external reasons, and we also know there should be factors other than capital and labor to be added into the model, these missing ingredients are hard to be exactly determined. So due to the complexity of system, the models created in the past 50 years are all not successful.



## Question 4 
Steve Jones is a famous evolutionary biologist. He was hired by uni-level to help design a better nozzle. The fluid dynamics are non‐linear, making this work extremely complicated so that many scientists are stucked at this process. The way steve tried is to make ten copies of the existing nozzle, randomly distort each of them and test which one worked best. He repeated this process again and again. After forty‐five generations, he created a nozzle with a huge improvement. Barder uses this example to introduce one characteristic of adaptive change, that is by making a small change each time, it can produce startling, game-changing jumps to new solutions in the end.  


## Question 5 

Barder proposes that all the successful products are not produced from scratch. Whatever products, techonologies, firms, industries or institutions, they all experienced many generations of adaptions and these adaptions are all changing in response to each other. It is a rich set of interations between many adaptive agents that compose our economy and society, and the place where they interact with each other is defined as the complex adaptive system.  

The complex adaptive systems has five important feature. First, they are difficult to predicted in detail because even a small and random change can lead to unimaginably huge changes in places you don’t know, as what butterfly effect indicates. Second, it is possible to can make broad brush prediction about the system as a whole. Third, those systems have emergent properties. Fourth, those systems tend towards greater complexity. Fifth, these systems do not tend towards an equilibrium. Unexpected changes always happen. 


## Question 6 

Haile Sellasie was the last Emperor of a feudal kingdom of Ethiopia which ruled until it was overthrown in 1974. Since Haile had the right to make all the decisions of everyone's life, his ministers and officials only told news that are beneficial to the Emperor and kept silence about the poverty and starvation in the countryside. Since any effort to move towards more inclusive political and social institutions may threaten the Emperor's position, the Emperor chose to enjoy the best services and quality of life himself by extracting economic value from his citizens and suppressing the systemic change. Similar things happen to our economy. When there's emergence of rich resources, powerful elites will take control of the revenues to maintain their power and position. Therefore, any evolution of the economic or political systems that may threaten their power will be suppressed. 


## Question 7 
Barder recommends resisting engineering as a policy implication because first, all the products, industries and institutions need to experience an evolutionary processes to achieve improvements. The best solution is always obatain through adaptation and changes according to environment, but the problem is hard to be scientifically solved. Second, it's almost impossible to predict what will happen in the complex non-linear system, and that would make enginerring solutions almost impossible. "Iso-morphic mimicry" is orginally a concept from evolutionary theory, that means animals tend to evolve to an appearance that looks poisonous instead of really being poisonous. Barder uses this concept to point out one problem in development. That is often organisations tend to perform as if they are making effective efforts in devlopment, by showing their organisational characteristics of a well-functioning institution, but in reality they have not ability to make changes.


## Question 8 
By "resist fatalism", Barder means that we cannot believe that the only thing we can do is to accept whatever outcome the process of evolution gives us. We need to believe that we are capable of making changes in the evolutionary process. Norman Borlaug is a man who brought about the Green Revolution by intervening in the evolutionary process to develop high‐yield, disease‐resistant wheat varieties. The Green Revolution is a process that uses those wheat varieties to save more tha a billion people from starvation.
