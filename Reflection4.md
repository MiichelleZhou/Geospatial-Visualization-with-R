# In-class Reflection 4

There’re enormous numbers of random individuals forming the complex networks that constitute the world we’re living in right now. Every day’s life is complex and diverse. In Geoff West’s book Scale, he proposes questions like and tries to provide answers by introducing scaling and scalability, which is by definition how things change with size. Scaling can be used to interpret a wide variety of phenomenon, whatever in the science, engineering, technology or any other aspect of our lives. In order to demonstrate the complexity of our social and economic systems, here’s three examples used by West to illustrate scale as a way of understanding human development. 


One question West discusses about is whether systems respond to a change in size in a linear way that can be easily predicted by the model. He proposes a simple question that can help people understand why the world is not as simple as our intuition might indicate: does an animal require half as much food if its weight is halved? Our intuition might be yes, but in fact an animal that is twice the size of another only consumes about 75% more food and energy each day, which does not follow our “classic linear thinking” (page 17). Also, different cities have different GDP per capita, which proves that the GDP of a city does not linearly respond to the city’s population. Predicting values through the linear extrapolation may always lead to wrong result. 


Besides, West also introduces another characteristics of complex systems, that is the whole is greater than the sum of all the individual constituents or agents the system comprises. “You are much more than the totality of your cells”(page 21). Also, this system always has no central control. Each individual spontaneiously assembles together to form the whole, which is described as "emergent behavior". An example given by West is the colony of ants. The colonies are always built without any central control or master plan. "Just thousands of ants working mindlessly in the dark moving millions of grains of earth and sand to create these impressive structures"(page 22). Ants' behavior shows that they are exactly an example of self-organization. 


In Chapter 7, when applyng the biological metaphor to cities, West introduces the sublinear scaling of the number of gas stations with city size. "The bigger the city the fewer the number of gas stations needed on a per capita basis. Thus, on average, each gas station in a larger city serves more people and consequently sells more fuel per month than in a smaller one" (page 272). He uses this example to accomplish a  translation from the scaling theory to urban systems. 

Throughout the book, West discusses extremely simple theories underlying the complex systems. "Scaling theory provides a powerful tool for forging a middle ground in which a quantitative framework can be developed for understanding and predicting the coarse-grained behavior of many broad aspects of such systems"(page 430). In 21st centry, he argues that the scaling theory is still relevent in the face of big data; however, he argues agaisnst a belief that many people take for granted - the more data the better. He makes a compelling argument against the “arrogance and narcissism” reflected in the growing fetishization of big data. “Data for data’s sake,or the mindless gathering of big data, without any conceptual framework for organizing and understanding it, may actually be bad or even dangerous.”(page 440).
